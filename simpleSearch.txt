Endoplasmic reticulum stress precedes oxidative stress in antibiotic-induced cholestasis and cytotoxicity in human hepatocytes.
 
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been associated with various drug-induced liver lesions but its participation in drug-induced cholestasis remains unclear. We first aimed at analyzing liver damage caused by various hepatotoxic antibiotics, including three penicillinase-resistant antibiotics (PRAs), i.e. flucloxacillin, cloxacillin and nafcillin, as well as trovafloxacin, levofloxacin and erythromycin, using human differentiated HepaRG cells and primary hepatocytes. All these antibiotics caused early cholestatic effects typified by bile canaliculi dilatation and reduced bile acid efflux within 2h and dose-dependent enhanced caspase-3 activity within 24h. PRAs induced the highest cholestatic effects at non cytotoxic concentrations. Then, molecular events involved in these lesions were analyzed. Early accumulation of misfolded proteins revealed by thioflavin-T fluorescence and associated with phosphorylation of the unfolded protein response sensors, eIF2&alpha; and/or IRE1&alpha;, was evidenced with all tested hepatotoxic antibiotics. Inhibition of ER stress markedly restored bile acid efflux and prevented bile canaliculi dilatation. Downstream of ER stress, ROS were also generated with high antibiotic concentrations. The protective HSP27-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was activated only in PRA-treated cells and its inhibition increased ROS production and aggravated caspase-3 activity. Overall, our results demonstrate that (i) various antibiotics reported to cause cholestasis and hepatocellular injury in the clinic can also induce such effects in in vitro human hepatocytes; (ii) PRAs cause the strongest cholestatic effects in the absence of cytotoxicity; (iii) cholestatic features occur early through ER stress; (iv) cytotoxic lesions are observed later through ER stress-mediated ROS generation; and (v) activation of the HSP27-PI3K-AKT pathway protects from cytotoxic damage induced by PRAs only.

Evaluation of a human in vitro hepatocyte-NPC co-culture model for the prediction of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury: A pilot study.
 
Interactions between hepatocytes and immune cells as well as inflammatory episodes are frequently discussed to play a critical role in the alteration of the individual susceptibility to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (iDILI). To evaluate this hypothesis and to face the urgent need for predictive <i>in vitro</i> models, we established two co-culture systems based on two human cell lines in presence or absence of pro-inflammatory factors (LPS, TNF), i.e. hepatoma HepG2 cells co-cultured with monocytic or macrophage-like THP-1 cells. HepG2 monocultures served as control scenario. Mono- or co-cultures were treated with iDILI reference substances (Troglitazone [TGZ], Trovafloxacin [TVX], Diclofenac [DcL], Ketoconazole [KC]) or their non-iDILI partner compounds (Rosiglitazone, Levofloxacin, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Fluconazole). The liver cell viability was subsequently determined via WST-Assay. An enhanced cytotoxicity (synergy) or a hormetic response compared to the drug effect in the HepG2 monoculture was considered as iDILI positive. TGZ synergized in co-cultures with monocytes without an additional pro-inflammatory stimulus, while DcL and KC showed a hormetic response. All iDILI drugs synergized with TNF in the simple HepG2 monoculture, indicating its relevance as an initiator of iDILI. KC showed a synergy when co-exposed to both, monocytes and LPS, while TVX and DcL showed a synergy under the same conditions with macrophages. All described iDILI responses were not observed with the corresponding non-iDILI partner compounds. Our first results confirm that an inflammatory environment increases the sensitivity of liver cells towards iDILI compounds and point to an involvement of pro-inflammatory factors, especially TNF, in the development of iDILI.

Bioprinted 3D Primary Liver Tissues Allow Assessment of Organ-Level Response to Clinical Drug Induced Toxicity In Vitro.
 
Modeling clinically relevant tissue responses using cell models poses a significant challenge for drug development, in particular for drug induced liver injury (DILI). This is mainly because existing liver models lack longevity and tissue-level complexity which limits their utility in predictive toxicology. In this study, we established and characterized novel bioprinted human liver tissue mimetics comprised of patient-derived hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells in a defined architecture. Scaffold-free assembly of different cell types in an in vivo-relevant architecture allowed for histologic analysis that revealed distinct intercellular hepatocyte junctions, CD31+ endothelial networks, and desmin positive, smooth muscle actin negative quiescent stellates. Unlike what was seen in 2D hepatocyte cultures, the tissues maintained levels of ATP, Albumin as well as expression and drug-induced enzyme activity of Cytochrome P450s over 4 weeks in culture. To assess the ability of the 3D liver cultures to model tissue-level DILI, dose responses of Trovafloxacin, a drug whose hepatotoxic potential could not be assessed by standard pre-clinical models, were compared to the structurally related non-toxic drug Levofloxacin. Trovafloxacin induced significant, dose-dependent toxicity at clinically relevant doses (&le; 4uM). Interestingly, Trovafloxacin toxicity was observed without lipopolysaccharide stimulation and in the absence of resident macrophages in contrast to earlier reports. Together, these results demonstrate that 3D bioprinted liver tissues can both effectively model DILI and distinguish between highly related compounds with differential profile. Thus, the combination of patient-derived primary cells with bioprinting technology here for the first time demonstrates superior performance in terms of mimicking human drug response in a known target organ at the tissue level.

Trovafloxacin-induced replication stress sensitizes HepG2 cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced cytotoxicity mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related.
 
Use of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic trovafloxacin (TVX) was restricted due to idiosyncratic, drug-induced liver injury (IDILI). Previous studies demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and TVX interact to cause death of hepatocytes in vitro that was associated with prolonged activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), activation of caspases 9 and 3, and DNA damage. The purpose of this study was to explore further the mechanism by which TVX interacts with TNF to cause cytotoxicity. Treatment with TVX caused cell cycle arrest, enhanced expression of p21 and impaired proliferation, but cell death only occurred after cotreatment with TVX and TNF. Cell death involved activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), which in turn activated caspase 3 and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), both of which contributed to cytotoxicity. Cotreatment of HepG2 cells with TVX and TNF caused double-strand breaks in DNA, and ERK contributed to this effect. Inhibition of caspase activity abolished the DNA strand breaks. The data suggest a complex interaction of TVX and TNF in which TVX causes replication stress, and the downstream effects are exacerbated by TNF, leading to hepatocellular death. These results raise the possibility that IDILI from TVX results from MAPK and ATR activation in hepatocytes initiated by interaction of cytokine signaling with drug-induced replication stress.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 mainly contributes to the glucuronidation of trovafloxacin.
 
Identification of drug-metabolizing enzyme(s) responsible for the metabolism of drugs is an important step to understand not only interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics but also molecular mechanisms of metabolite-related toxicity. While it was reported that the major metabolic pathway of trovafloxacin, which is an antibiotic, was glucuronidation, the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoform(s) responsible for the trovafloxacin glucuronidation has not been identified yet. In the present study, among the functional human UGT members, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT1A9 exhibited higher trovafloxacin acyl-glucuronidation activities. While other UGT members such as UGT1A8, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 showed glucuronidation activity toward trovafloxacin, the metabolic velocity was extremely low. In human liver microsomes, trovafloxacin acyl-glucuronidation followed the Hill equation with S50 value of 95 &mu;M, Vmax value of 243 pmol/min per mg, and a Hill coefficient of 2.0, while the UGT1A1-expressing system displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a substrate inhibition, with Km value of 759 &mu;M and Vmax value of 1160 pmol/min per mg. In human liver microsomes prepared from poor metabolizers (UGT1A1*28/*28), significantly reduced trovafloxacin acyl-glucuronide formation activity was observed, indicating that UGT1A1 mainly, while other UGT members such as UGT1A3 and UGT1A9 partially, contributes to the glucuronidation of trovafloxacin.

Molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular apoptosis induced by trovafloxacin-tumor necrosis factor-alpha interaction.
 
Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) continues to be a significant human health problem. IDILI is characterized as occurring in a minority of individuals exposed to a drug, yet it accounts for as much as 17% of all cases of acute liver failure. Despite these concerns, the mechanisms underlying IDILI remain unknown. Trovafloxacin (TVX), which causes IDILI in humans, also causes hepatocellular death in vitro when combined with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this toxicity are not fully characterized. The purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms by which TVX and TNF interact to cause hepatocellular death, with a focus on a human hepatocyte cell line. TVX and TNF interacted to cause cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells at drug concentrations similar to those in people undergoing TVX therapy. TVX/TNF treatment caused apoptosis and DNA damage in HepG2 cells that depended on caspase activation. Prolonged activation of JNK occurred in TVX/TNF-induced cytotoxicity, and treatment with the JNK selective inhibitor SP600125 attenuated cytotoxicity. TVX/TNF cotreatment also caused cytotoxicity in isolated primary murine hepatocytes that was dependent on caspase activation. These results increase understanding of molecular signaling pathways involved in hepatocellular death caused by a drug with idiosyncratic liability in the presence of TNF.

Implication of hepatic transporters (MDR1 and MRP2) in inflammation-associated idiosyncratic drug-induced hepatotoxicity investigated by microvolume cytometry.
 
Idiosyncratic drug-induced hepatotoxicity accounts for about 13% of all cases of acute liver failure, therefore cited as the most frequent reason for post-marketing drug withdrawal. Despite this, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood due to lack in adequate screening assays and predictive in vitro models. Hepatic transporters play a crucial role in the absorption, distribution, and elimination of both endogenous substrates and xenobiotics. Defects in transporter function can lead to altered drug disposition, including toxicity and loss of efficacy. Inflammation is one condition for demonstrated variable drug response, attributed in part, to changes in function of drug transporters. The present study investigates the implication of two important hepatic transporters (MDR1 and MRP2) in idiosyncratic drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the presence and absence of an inflammatory context. The synergistic effect of idiosyncratic drugs (Trovafloxacin, nimesulide, telithromycin, and nefazodone) and inflammatory stimuli (TNF-&alpha; + LPS) on the efflux activity of hepatic transporters was studied using microvolume cytometry. Our results demonstrated on the one hand that both MDR1 and MRP2 are variably implicated in idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury and on the other hand that the occurrence of an inflammatory reaction during idiosyncratic drug therapy can noticeably modulate this implication. In the absence of an inflammatory stress, none of the four tested drugs modulated the efflux activity of MRP2; nevertheless telithromycin and nefazodone inhibited the efflux activity of MDR1. Upon occurrence of an inflammatory stress, the inhibitory potential of trovafloxacin, nimesulide, and nefazodone on the efflux activity of MRP2 was noticeably revealed, while the telithromycin and nefazodone-induced inhibition of MDR1 was clearly attenuated. Knowledge of underlying mechanisms may significantly contribute to elimination of potential hepatotoxic drugs long before marketing and to prevention of drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

Multi-cell type human liver microtissues for hepatotoxicity testing.
 
Current 2-dimensional hepatic model systems often fail to predict chemically induced hepatotoxicity due to the loss of a hepatocyte-specific phenotype in culture. For more predictive in vitro models, hepatocytes have to be maintained in a 3-dimensional environment that allows for polarization and cell-cell contacts. Preferably, the model will reflect an in vivo-like multi-cell type environment necessary for liver-like responses. Here, we report the characterization of a multi-cell type microtissue model, generated from primary human hepatocytes and liver-derived non-parenchymal cells. Liver microtissues were stable and functional for 5 weeks in culture enabling, for example, long-term toxicity testing of acetaminophen and diclofenac. In addition, Kupffer cells were responsive to inflammatory stimuli such as LPS demonstrating the possibility to detect inflammation-mediated toxicity as exemplified by the drug trovafloxacin. Herewith, we present a novel 3D liver model for routine testing in 96-well format capable of reducing the risk of unwanted toxic effects in the clinic.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury and the role of inflammatory stress with an emphasis on an animal model of trovafloxacin hepatotoxicity.
 
Idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IADRs) occur in a minority of patients yet account for the majority of postmarketing use restrictions by the Food and Drug Administration. Despite the impact of these toxicities, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Animal models of IADRs would be beneficial in understanding mechanisms and in developing assays with predictive potential. Recent work exploring the interactions between inflammatory stress and drugs associated with human idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) has led to the development of the first animal models that apply to a range of drugs. Here, we discuss hypotheses for the mechanisms of IDILI and focus on a murine model of trovafloxacin-induced hepatotoxicity as an example related to the inflammatory stress hypothesis.

Cytokine-associated drug toxicity in human hepatocytes is associated with signaling network dysregulation.
 
Idiosyncratic drug hepatotoxicity is a major problem in pharmaceutical development due to poor prediction capability of standard preclinical toxicity assessments and limited knowledge of its underlying mechanisms. Findings in animal models have shown that adverse effects of numerous drugs with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans can be reproduced in the presence of coincident inflammatory cytokine signaling. Following these observations, we have recently developed an in vitro drug/inflammatory cytokine co-treatment approach that can reproduce clinical drug hepatotoxicity signatures-particularly for idiosyncratic drugs-in cultured primary human hepatocytes. These observations have suggested that drug-induced stresses may interact with cytokine signaling to induce hepatic cytotoxicity, but the hepatocyte signaling mechanisms governing these interactions are poorly understood. Here, we collect high-throughput phosphoprotein signaling and cytotoxicity measurements in cultured hepatocytes, from multiple human donors, treated with combinations of hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. trovafloxacin, clarithromycin) and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin-1 alpha, and interleukin-6). We demonstrate, through orthogonal partial least-squares regression (OPLSR) modeling of these signal-response data, that drug/cytokine hepatic cytotoxicity is integratively controlled by four key signaling pathways: Akt, p70 S6 kinase, MEK-ERK, and p38-HSP27. This modeling predicted, and experimental studies confirmed, that the MEK-ERK and p38-HSP27 pathways contribute pro-death signaling influences in drug/cytokine hepatic cytotoxicity synergy. Further, our four-pathway OPLSR model produced successful prediction of drug/cytokine hepatic cytotoxicities across different human donors, even though signaling and cytotoxicity responses were both highly donor-specific. Our findings highlight the critical role of kinase signaling in drug/cytokine hepatic cytotoxicity synergies and reveal that hepatic cytotoxicity responses are governed by multi-pathway signaling network balance.

Trovafloxacin-induced gene expression changes in liver-derived in vitro systems: comparison of primary human hepatocytes to HepG2 cells.
 
Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) are a main instrument in drug metabolism research and in the prediction of drug-induced phase I/II enzyme induction in humans. The HepG2 liver-derived cell line is commonly used as a surrogate for human hepatocytes, but its use in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and toxicity studies can be limited because of lowered basal levels of metabolizing enzymes. Despite the widespread use of HepG2 cells, a comparison of their transcriptomes with those of PHH has not been well characterized. In this study, microarray analysis was conducted to ascertain the differences and similarities in mRNA expression between HepG2 cells and human hepatocytes before and after exposure to a panel of fluoroquinolone compounds. Comparison of the naive HepG2 cell and PHH transcriptomes revealed a substantial number of basal gene expression differences. When HepG2 cells were dosed with a series of fluoroquinolones, trovafloxacin (TVX), which has been associated with human idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, induced substantially more gene expression changes than the other quinolones, similar to previous observations with PHH. Although TVX-treatment resulted in many gene expression differences between HepG2 cells and PHH, there were also a number of TVX-induced commonalities, including genes involved in RNA processing and mitochondrial function. Taken together, these results provide insight for interpretation of results from drug metabolism and toxicity studies conducted with HepG2 cells in lieu of PHH and could provide further insight into the mechanistic evaluation of TVX-induced hepatotoxicity.
